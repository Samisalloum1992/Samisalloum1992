# Hi Everyone: Sami here! 
Currently, I work in a **Large Financial Institution** in Treasury & Resolution Planning. I report on all activities of the bank's core business lines to the FDIC as part of the mandatory requirement to submit a full resolution plan for the bank in case of bankruptcy and how the bank would continue its commitments to depositors. 
My expertise has always been in **Public Policy**, **counterterrorism** and **compliance**. Prior to banking, I worked with United Nations systems, particularly around UN Security Council. 
I possess two Master's degrees, one in **International Affairs** and the second in **Negotiations and Conflict Resolution** from **Columbia University**. My BA is in Political Science. 
I **joined TripleTen Business Intelligence** program in March 2024 and I want to elevate my data analysis skills. My aim is to use advanced data analysis and statistics skills to identify risks and ensure compliance with the ever-growing regulatory landscape.  
During my learning journey at Triple 10, I learned advanced Excel skills, Tableau, SQL and Power BI. I created and worked on many projects and now I feel confident that I can kick a career combining both data analysis and public policy. 
I lived in Lebanon and I have been in New York for the past 6 years.
In my free time, I will either be working out, running, cycling, cooking or singing!
